After some searching about blog providers, I finally chose WordPress over others. And so my blogging experience starts… .

Yesterday, I arrived at my room after about 19 hours of hard work (specially at the Sina hospital)… and then I just fainted :) . It was a very busy day and made me quite tired. Some complex cases (including a man with LBBB heart block who presented symptoms of an MI and a man with an old necrotic ulcer on his leg and probably an osteomyelitis under it) was the way that the day started.

I woke up about 6 hours ago. Thanks God. What a refreshing sleep!
