Here are some quick notes on installing PyMol in OSX Mountain Lion using MacPorts:

1- First install [Xquartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/), which is basically X11 for OSX 10.8.

2- Install PyMol using MacPorts:

```
sudo port install tcl -corefoundation +threads
sudo port install tk -quartz +x11
sudo port install pymol-devel

# PyMol will be installed here:
/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pymol
```

Note that MacPorts might not create the symbolic link for launching PyMol
(which is basically `__init__.py` in the installation folder). So make an
alias/link for it and remember to launch it using ``/opt/local/bin/python2.7` (if
it is not your default python).

This currently installs PyMol 1.5. You can also compile the latest version of
PyMol (as of now 1.6 alpha) by downloading it and then using:

```
sudo /opt/local/bin/python2.7 setup.py install --home=~
```

This creates “bin” and “lib” directories in your home folder and then installs PyMol there.
