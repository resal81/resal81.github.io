If you do some sort of molecular modeling, you almost certainly used one or
more scripting languages to make your life easier. I’ve tried some of them and
my favorite by far is [Python][python]. Other than being very readable and having simple
syntax, one thing that especially makes Python very useful, is [myriad][pypi] of
available modules that enhance the core functionality. For example you can use
[Numpy][numpy] to do fast numerical analysis, [Scipy][scipy] to do linear algebra calculations,
[mathplolib][mpl] to plot your data, [MDAnalysis][mda] to analyze your simulation
trajectories or use [Prody][prody] to do GNM calculations.

If you are new to Python and interested to learn more about it, here are two
tips:

- If you are looking for a point to start, I recommend [this interactive tutorial][tut1]
and [learn Python the hard way][tut2].  

- There are some Python distributions available that package both core Python
  and useful modules in one easily installable file. Enthought Python
  Distribution (EPD), from [Enthought][ent], is a good one and free to academics. If
  you’d like to install it, go [here][entdown] and request an academic license and install
  EPD.

Have fun Pythoning!
