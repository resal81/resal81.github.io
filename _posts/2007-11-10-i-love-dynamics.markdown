Long time from my last post! Quite busy these days, I actually can not find any free time. Now I am at surgery ward, in which the daily work starts at 6:00 AM until 11:00 AM, and we usually have 12 shifts per month. Besides, work from my thesis, GRE exam, my applications to universities and some minor things (like the lecture I have to present this Monday about diabetics foot) fill any minute amount of free time. However, I see all these businesses as the dynamics of life (although I think the kinetic energy of my dynamics is relatively high!) and like my scientific interests, I love dynamics!
